What is the significance of cybersecurity?
 

Everyone benefits from improved cyber defense strategies in today's linked society. A cybersecurity intrusion on an individual can result in everything from identity theft to extortion attempts to the loss of sensitive data such as family pictures. Everyone is reliant on crucial infrastructure such as power plants, hospitals, and financial institutions. Securing these and other organisations is critical to the operation of our society.

Everyone benefits from the efforts of cyberthreat researchers, such as Talos' 250-person threat research team, which investigates new and emerging threats and cyber assault techniques. They identify new vulnerabilities, educate the public about the significance of cybersecurity, and fortify open source technologies. Their efforts make the Internet a safer place for everyone.
